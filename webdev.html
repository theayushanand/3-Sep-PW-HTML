     <h2> Understanding Web Development </h2>  
     <p>
Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run 
<br> on the internet. It involves a combination of front-end development, which 
<br> focuses on the user interface and experience, and back-end development, which
<br> manages server-side operations, databases, and application logic.
<br>
    </p>
    
<h2>Front-End Development</h2>

<p>
Front-end development deals with everything that users interact with directly on a 
<br> website or web application. This includes the layout, design, and 
<br>interactivity of a site. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the
<br> backbone of front-end development, allowing developers to create visually <br>appealing and responsive user interfaces.
</p>

<h2>Back-End Development</h2>
<p>
    The back-end is the engine that powers the front-end. It involves server-side <br>programming, databases, and application logic. Back-end developers work with <br>server technologies like Node.js, databases like MongoDB, and frameworks like <br>Express.js to ensure that the website functions correctly and efficiently. The <br>back-end is responsible for managing data, handling user requests, and serving <br>content to the front-end.
</p>
<h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
<p>
    A Full Stack Developer is proficient in both front-end and back-end development. <br>They have the skills to create a fully functional web application from start to <br>, managing both the user-facing side and the server-side logic. With the rise <br>of modern web frameworks and tools, full stack development has become an <br>increasingly popular approach in building dynamic and complex web applications.
